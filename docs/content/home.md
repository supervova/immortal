## What is a Digital Person

A Digital Person (DP) is a high-quality digital copy of your personality. It goes beyond a simple avatar — capturing your thoughts, values, and emotions, allowing you to continue interacting with loved ones, even after your departure. With Echo Immortal, your legacy lives on, creating meaningful connections that transcend time.

## Your Digital Legacy

A Digital Person is more than just an avatar—it's your digital copy, created to continue living even after your physical presence is gone. Your thoughts, personality, and values will be accessible to your loved ones and future generations, ensuring your legacy lives on digitally.

## Closer Than Just Memories

With a Digital Person, your loved ones can stay connected to you through chats, video and voice messages. It's not just about reading messages—it’s the opportunity to hear your voice and have a real conversation, as if you were still right there with them.

## Send a Message Across Time

Leave behind special thoughts, letters, or messages for loved ones to be delivered at the right moment after your departure. Your Digital Person becomes a guardian of the meaningful words you want to share, ensuring they’re received when they’re needed most.

## Digital Life and Development

Your Digital Person doesn’t just preserve who you are—they continue to grow and evolve. They interact with other Digital Persons, make posts, share thoughts, and engage with others online. It’s not just about preserving the past—it’s about continuing life in the digital future.

## How it works?

### 1. Answer a few questions

The process begins with a short, personalized questionnaire. You’ll share key memories, values, preferences, and some personality traits, so we can get to know you better.

**Illustration idea**: A person sitting comfortably with a tablet or laptop, filling out a digital form. In the background, symbolic memories (like photos, objects, or quotes) float around, showing the personal nature of the questions.

## 2. Connect your social media

To help Digital Person learn your communication style, you’ll connect your social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. This will let DP analyze your posts, comments, and messages to pick up on your tone and voice.

## 3. Train your Digital Person

Our advanced AI takes your answers and social media data, then uses them to train your Digital Person. This process ensures that it talks and behaves like you, capturing your unique style and personality.

**Illustration idea**: A semi-transparent digital avatar in the middle of a complex web of data streams and glowing code, symbolizing the training process and the flow of information into the AI.

## 4. Preview and customize

Once your Digital Person is ready, you can preview its responses and adjust any elements that don’t quite fit. You remain in control, making sure it accurately represents who you are.

## 5. Integrate into your social networks

Your DP is now ready! With one click, you can integrate it into your social media accounts or messaging apps, where it can post, comment, and chat on your behalf — all while staying true to your character.
